# FINDMYIMAGE
This android app helps in searching image from the tags you enter in the search box just like google search.
Following are the keypoints of the application:
1. Downloading data using Async Task and Parsing JSON DATA.
2. Usage of Gesture Detector and Material Design.
3. We also used flickr api for the image database and also used PICASSO API so that are cache is efficient and the memory is not used that         much.
4. Implementation of the search functionality.
